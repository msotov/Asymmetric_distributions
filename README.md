Asymmetric_distributions

Code to draw samples from an asymmetric distribution, defined by a mean value, plus asymmetric uncertainties. 
This will create an skewnormal distribution using the mean value plus the uncertainties, and will later draw random samples from that distribution.

Useful for working with quantities with asymmetric uncertainties.
